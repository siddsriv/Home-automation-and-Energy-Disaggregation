# Home-automation-and-Energy-Disaggregation

This is the complementary repository the project: Ubermensch Home Automation System

We made a portable home automation box that would actuate as many devices as attached (easily expandable to any number of devices) and also collects operational data of the appliances to feed into an energy disaggregation model. This model ensures that any particular house operates at peak efficiency and saves energy.<br/>
